# Replication Paper Rant or Rave Variation Over Time in the Language of Online Reviews

This repository contains the coding file and data set access links, that build the basis for the report "Reproduction and Replication of the Paper:  "Rant or Rave: Variation Over Time in  the Language of Online Reviews". 

The respective coding file, that includes all steps from the data loading, preperation, sampling, and analysis, as well as the table and figure generation, is the "Project.ipynb" file. The "Results" folder stores all analysis results as pickles, that can be loaded if wished to check the result correctness or generate different visualizations. 

The "Data" folder includes a markdown file that states the links where the complete unprepared data sets of the underlying analysis can be downloaded, as unfortunately an upload of them was not possible due to their size. If one would like to have the original data sets or their sampled versions please do not refrain from contacting me.




## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for one of my master's fourth projects for the course "Social Media Data Analysis". In this course we had to do a final project, where one possible task was to select a interesting publication, reproduce its results, replicate its analysis using a different data basis, and write a report about what we found due the reproduction and replication process. I choose to replicate and reproduce the results for one of the three main data sets of the publication:

- Ziser, Y., Webber, B., & Cohen, S. B. (2023). Rant or rave: variation over time in the language of online reviews. Language Resources and Evaluation, 1-31.

The publications focuses on the question how language of online reviews has changed over the past decades. Specifcially centres around the change trends affecting the sentiment intensity, lexical diversity, and comprehensiveness of online reviews.
