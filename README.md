# Replication Paper Rant or Rave Variation Over Time in the Language of Online Reviews

This repository contains the coding file and data set access links, that build the basis for the report "Reproduction and Replication of the Paper:  "Rant or Rave: Variation Over Time in  the Language of Online Reviews". 

The respective coding file, that includes all steps from the data loading, preperation, sampling, and analysis, as well as the table and figure generation, is the "Project.ipynb" file. The "Results" folder stores all analysis results as pickles, that can be loaded if wished to check the result correctness or generate different visualizations. 

The "Data" folder includes a markdown file that states the links where the complete unprepared data sets of the underlying analysis can be downloaded, as unfortunately an upload of them was not possible due to their size. If one would like to have the original data sets or their sampled versions please do not refrain from contacting me.




## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for one of my fourth master's projects for the course "Social Media Data Analysis". In this course we had to do a final project where one possible task was to select an interesting publication, reproduce its results, replicate its analysis using a different dataset, and write a report about what we found due to the reproduction and replication process. I chose to replicate and reproduce the results for one of the three main datasets in the publication:

- Ziser, Y., Webber, B., & Cohen, S. B. (2023). Rant or rave: variation over time in the language of online reviews. Language Resources and Evaluation, 1-31.

This paper focuses on how the language of online reviews has changed over the last few decades. In particular, it focuses on the trends of change that affect the sentiment intensity, lexical diversity and comprehensiveness of online reviews.

## Objectives
- Reproduce the results of Ziser et al. (2023) for one of the three main studied datasets.
- Replicate the results using a different dataset than originally studied.

## Key Findings
- Ziser et al.'s (2023) results are reproducible, which means that reviews increase in the sentiment intensity, reduce in their lexical diversity, and decrease in the general comprehensiveness. These trends are also to a high degree statistically significant.
