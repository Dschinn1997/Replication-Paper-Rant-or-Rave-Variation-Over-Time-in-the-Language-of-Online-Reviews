# Replication Paper Rant or Rave Variation Over Time in the Language of Online Reviews

This repository contains the coding file and data set access links, that build the basis for the report "Reproduction and Replication of the Paper:  "Rant or Rave: Variation Over Time in  the Language of Online Reviews". 

The respective coding file, that includes all steps from the data loading, preperation, sampling, and analysis, as well as the table and figure generation, is the "Project.ipynb" file. The "Results" folder stores all analysis results as pickles, that can be loaded if wished to check the result correctness or generate different visualizations. 

The "Data" folder includes a markdown file that states the links where the complete unprepared data sets of the underlying analysis can be downloaded, as unfortunately an upload of them was not possible due to their size. If one would like to have the original data sets or their sampled versions please do not refrain from contacting me.




## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for one of my master's fourth semester term papers for the course "Social Media Data Analysis". For the term paper we, Trinidad Bosch Achondo and I, investigated the role of bots on social media given the widespread concern about an "malicious social bot pandemic". Thereby, we focused on analyzing the topics bots discuss, the sentiments they convey, and if we find indications for malicious intentions.

## Objectives
