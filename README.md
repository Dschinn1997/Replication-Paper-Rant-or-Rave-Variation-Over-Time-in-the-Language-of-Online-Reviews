# SMDA-Project
This repository contains the coding file and data set access links, that build the basis for the report "Reproduction and Replication of the Paper:  "Rant or Rave: Variation Over Time in  the Language of Online Reviews". 

The respective coding file, that includes all steps from the data loading, preperation, sampling, and analysis, as well as the table and figure generation, is the "Project.ipynb" file. The "Results" folder stores all analysis results as pickles, that can be loaded if wished to check the result correctness or generate different visualizations. 

The "Data" folder includes a markdown file that states the links where the complete unprepared data sets of the underlying analysis can be downloaded, as unfortunately an upload of them was not possible due to their size. If one would like to have the original data sets or their sampled versions please do not refrain from contacting me.
