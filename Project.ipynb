You order at the counter and they deliver it.\\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we\\'d only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn\\'t be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \\n\\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn\\'t on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \\nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing.

Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal.

That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late).

Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's.

They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \\n\\nThe fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\\n\\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \\n\\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\\n\\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \\n\\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!\\n\\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. \\n\\nOverall, this place is great!

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \\n\\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \\n\\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \\n\\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.\",\n  'date': '2013-08-03 16:26:48'},\n {'review_id': 'kj5pjfid6pUP818rF0q6GQ',\n  'user_id': 'dWTrJdEPoZB8LkOPv_jxsA',\n  'business_id': 'cg4JFJcCxRTTMmcg9O9KtA',\n  'stars': 4.0,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it.

Scrumptious!\\n\\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust.

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.

I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\\n\\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.

We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers, the alligator came out within 15 minutes, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later, our raw oysters came out, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price, I shouldn't complain too much about this place.

Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.

I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours.

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \\n\\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\\n\\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \\n\\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \\n\\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \\n\\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \\n\\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\\n\\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \\n\\nI really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.\",\n  'date': '2017-09-09 00:09:15'},\n {'review_id': 'mcl6XhpC7hoUqkTJcmUpkw',\n  'user_id': 'ZjzvfgBP9F3hfGMpHsCozw',\n  'business_id': 'WO5nr-4sjVs506BdCLL0aA',\n  'stars': 5.0,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'Great food for the price. \\nTender steak and perfectly cooked shrimp. \\nWould certainly come back.',\n  'date': '2016-11-09 23:40:11'},\n {'review_id': '6d9hz8LsjvkXjViPW4xaRA',\n  'user_id': 't77iaBQb3pyj2rtwffiLEg',\n  'business_id': 'ZnAr0AxYpEYK1ZHNc4fk7g',\n  'stars': 2.0,\n  'useful': 4,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp.

I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\\n\\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I\\'ve had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\\n\\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\\n\\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.',\n  'date': '2015-08-19 04:11:47'},\n {'review_id': 'amIMShQBXjITXiYG6gyiaA',\n  'user_id': 'Q1WRnsP8net9hJ-IkU9-4A',\n  'business_id': 'SuQgcpL-aZeuyRjBdA0pHw',\n  'stars': 1.0,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'What a disappointment.

He advised me there was a phone that was on the wall that I could make a call to someone if I needed to. He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.\\n\\nThe Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.\\nThere wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning.

I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.\\n\\nOverall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes.

I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.  I contacted an attorney and per his review I again called the dealership and asked for a time to return the vehicle and take back my trade.  Still no response!

Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.\\n\\nI decided to get the one-meat plate with \"wet\" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end.

The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,\\n\\nWe both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. \\n\\nThough they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. \\n\\nOur group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \\n\\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \\n\\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. \\n\\nAnother unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. \\n\\nThe only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done.

Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn\\'t get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.\\n\\nI purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn\\'t my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. \\n\\nAfter sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn\\'t something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn\\'t be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \"finished car\" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. \\n\\nAfter all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that\\'s the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we\\'ve been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \"I don\\'t know\" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don\\'t know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \\n\\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process.

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\\n\\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\\n\\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\\n\\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \\n\\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\\n\\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.\",\n  'date': '2013-11-14 01:23:03'},\n {'review_id': 'RNf8aUDzK2wzzO7sVzIkbQ',\n  'user_id': 'xjQSpme1Z7Xw8XehRLpYuA',\n  'business_id': 'EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ',\n  'stars': 4.0,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"fuck yes. meat, bourbon libations, and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese, bacon, dressing, etc to disguise the quality of the meat.

Big portions at decent prices.

My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\\n\\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\\n\\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\\n\\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \\n\\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \\n\\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\\n\\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\\n\\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\\n\\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.\",\n  'date': '2012-07-16 17:27:36'},\n {'review_id': 'GXlrpVd8rnL8gMgxczbd1g',\n  'user_id': 'q-EBNzv_YO5CE0Q_Ln7D5Q',\n  'business_id': 'vOgQnvKbE4nMopFTjoL8Gg',\n  'stars': 2.0,\n  'useful': 2,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming.

I visited Stitch-It in June 2013\\n\\nIn brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn\\'t mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nComplete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn\\'t have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn\\'t give me the warm and fuzzies.  \\n\\nStitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I\\'d have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won\\'t touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  \\n\\nI contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who\\'s name I can\\'t remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O\\'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.

We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\\n\\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby\\'s cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \\n\\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \\n\\nI am a fan!

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\\nBut whats this? \\nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\\n\\nNo.\\nNo, it can\\'t be! \\nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\\n\\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\\nWhy am I here?\\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\\n\\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that\\'s silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \\n\\nZaika \\'s appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\\n \\nI\\'ve become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn\\'t too soft. It\\'s nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \\nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\\n\\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\\n\\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \\n\\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\\n\\nP.S.\\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \\nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios.

We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \\n\\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \\n\\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \\n\\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side.

Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone\\'s order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn\\'t the issue.

I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see \"how they do things\" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.\\n\\nI did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn\\'t be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn\\'t need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.\\n\\nWe started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I\\'ve had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don\\'t have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. \\n\\nWe then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it\\'s too hot for me, I don\\'t taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn\\'t be overcooked, and they weren\\'t. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?\\n\\nWe then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).\\n\\nLike Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the \\'orange-y\\' sauce like other pad thai\\'s, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. \\n\\nMy dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don\\'t live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.\\n\\nI did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. \\n\\nI didn\\'t get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn\\'t think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.',\n  'date': '2013-06-24 09:58:07'},\n {'review_id': 'MIvAWbDNBsj5veOvsftNgw',\n  'user_id': '758g6NGLp9deCbvowz62Ww',\n  'business_id': 'z6SVTb9eFIcWVpKXIfFEvQ',\n  'stars': 4.0,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"Sometimes I just head on over to Kingsway if I need a little shopping fix, instead of battling the crowds at West Ed.

I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I took my parents out to dinner.  I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home.

I visited on 3/8/13 and got their \"Mini Manicure\"- it\\'s only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3/18/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I\\'m not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.\\n\\nI was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.\\n\\nI\\'m conflicted, but I don\\'t know that I\\'ll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn\\'t gel- because I can\\'t even take the polish off myself.  So I\\'m forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it\\'s Monday afternoon....',\n  'date': '2013-03-18 20:32:27'},\n {'review_id': 'DhA2QaUSdz2m9GirtOrzJA',\n  'user_id': 'AkH0edUmxPnieWabfJQIBA',\n  'business_id': '1ys1jf1-4EuiHONfpHWdwg',\n  'stars': 4.0,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': 'A bit off the beaten path for most tourists, as it is in the Marigny, but worth the trip.

With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.\\n\\nThey took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.\\n\\nVideo games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.\\n\\nMore TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).\\n\\nA word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.\\n\\nTypically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.\\n\\nThe food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. \\n\\nThose staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.\\n\\nHappy Hour 2pm - 6pm Monday -  Friday; Late Happy Hour 10pm - close Monday - Thursday.

He said this medicine he\\'s gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he\\'s definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she\\'s styling my hair and she said she doesn\\'t do hair and I wouldn\\'t want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn\\'t happy, she told the lady she didn\\'t like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn\\'t happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That\\'s not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don\\'t like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it\\'s not orange it\\'s the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn\\'t the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn\\'t what I wanted and it wasn\\'t gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn\\'t get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn\\'t mess up, he\\'s been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn\\'t be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don\\'t care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I\\'m always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.',\n  'date': '2018-02-11 04:01:35'},\n {'review_id': '5Ord-c6rkWrbWWz39i6J5g',\n  'user_id': 'v89gB-GD6AAflPtVL-4iDw',\n  'business_id': 'k3lTRgvPvYUI-cX7_TAqNA',\n  'stars': 5.0,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"I am so glad we had our wedding here!!! I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! \\n\\nWe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\\n\\nThe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.\\n\\nWhat I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \\n\\nThe attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.\\n\\nFive stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.\",\n  'date': '2015-12-20 21:47:02'},\n {'review_id': 'XDAv3vVYTwCOhGAeeNLXsg',\n  'user_id': 'w90KNnzS6Ao3k-njRlCEeA',\n  'business_id': '2bl6G1zgXUHbMGwEocqMSg',\n  'stars': 5.0,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot.

My first exposure to his succulent birds was the hot chicken at The Fat Ham. Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer.

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you\\'ll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That\\'s a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\\n\\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner\\'s palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I\\'ve tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\\n\\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\\n\\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.\\n\\n   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.\\n\\n  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?\\n\\nIn the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! \\n\\nThe hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!\\n\\nOn our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.\\n\\nAt checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did!

We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. \\n\\nThe only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.\\n\\nPLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) \\n\\nSWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.

And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \\n\\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn\\'t quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\\n\\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can\\'t wait to come back and order another one.

After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.

I am really glad I chose them.\\n\\nFirst off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don\\'t mind the typical \"shop\" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.\\n\\nNext off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.\\n\\nJuan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.\\n\\nI got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people\\'s standards.\\n\\nIt sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.',\n  'date': '2013-12-06 23:51:40'},\n {'review_id': 's_X5uNLjLSgK_itDNFiadg',\n  'user_id': 'NZdASLiCRqQI1yIl9MIY5w',\n  'business_id': 'MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q',\n  'stars': 4.0,\n  'useful': 0,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 0,\n  'text': \"I am from Colorado and am visiting Santa Barbara and let me tell you... what a great place to eat.

I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. \\n\\nI walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I\\'ve had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn\\'t mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don\\'t come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. \\n\\nShe gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone\\'s favorite part, and the technician\\'s opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just \"drinking up all the lotion.\" Yes, I realize it\\'s dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. \\n\\nWhen I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn\\'t care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! \\n\\nOverall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn\\'t even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here.',\n  'date': '2017-01-14 22:16:55'},\n {'review_id': 'IDLGZOMnn6JTFXAZ3k8l6Q',\n  'user_id': 'x_NfifOcHluxCC84iC-0Rg',\n  'business_id': 'uW2oyOCEN3RgS7j2MfUIkg',\n  'stars': 5.0,\n  'useful': 1,\n  'funny': 0,\n  'cool': 1,\n  'text': 'I got the hot shave and it did not disappoint.

Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was \"too bad\". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service.

And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn\\'t yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.\\n\\nI should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time.

I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.\\n\\nMBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren\\'t \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don\\'t like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour\\'s time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I\\'ve ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don\\'t. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\\n\\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don\\'t care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won\\'t like MBSC.

However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.

Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop.

The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \\nThe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend\\'s apartment than a hotel. \\n\\nFree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It\\'s not a hot breakfast (I\\'ve had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I\\'m not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. \\n\\nCoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They\\'re also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\\n\\nI\\'ve read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn\\'t hear a thing. And I\\'m a very light sleeper...\\n\\nA few things to note:\\nIts location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you\\'re traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \\n\\nThere\\'s a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you\\'re not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6\\'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\\n\\nDon\\'t expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that\\'s what the city is for... go out there and see something!\\n\\nOverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find.
